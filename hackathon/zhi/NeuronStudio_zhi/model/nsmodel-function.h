/* A number of restrictions are imposed on labeling objects with a function type...

1) An origin vertex is always set to "soma" by default, and cannot be set to anything else. (DONE)

2) Objects to be added to the "soma" must form a path (i.e. weakly connected) to any existing objects labeled as "soma".
	i.e. the "soma" objects themselves must always from a weakly connected sub-graph.

3) The "soma" objects cannot be split (disconnected) by re-labeling one or more of the existing objects. Again the "soma"
	must exist as a weakly connected sub-graph.

4) Resetting an origin vertex clears function labeling, unless it is reset to a vertex that is also part of the "soma". (DONE)

5) Select subtree stops at soma type. (DONE)
